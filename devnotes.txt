to add a command to mavproxy.py, need to alter the command_map, which contains the list of commands and brief description
added blobkTrack.py to modules folder, needs to be updated with stable version from ground station
	camera variables to store: hvsL, hsvU, blurRad, flagShowVis, capture, flagOut
include hsvUpdate in the main loop

basic camera integration complete but fails

try to run image proc as a seeparate process.
	possible cf. tcp examples on FSLtemp

MAVlink: use message ID's starting at 200. we now know how to create new MAVlink messages. Now we must learn how to integrate them into the GS and the MAV.

I believe I have editted Arduplane\GCS_Mavlink.ino to receive a VSCL MAVLink message and bounce back a 1 using the same message ID.
	must include VSCL header files in GCS_Mavlink.h
	Now, I must figure out how to get the GCS to transmit and receive the same message.
	It looks like any MAVLink commands are going to be processed in mavproxy.py in function master_callback. However, I may be able to SEND it from an external process. 
	Otherwise, perhaps I can incorporate this functionality into periodic_tasks().
	New plan: piggyback centroid acquisition from camera streaming process into periodic_tasks. Should run at 1 Hz.
	mavutil contains a periodic_event class that should work nicely.
