log 19 is the last flight from 2014-01-29 (all regulation loops on)
log 16 is probably the flight with airspeed, pitch, and roll regulation
log 14 is something, may be the aborted flight with short battery
log 10 by extension should be the flight with pitch and roll regulation... unclear
log 4 is a flight from the first day - so probably the one with yaw regulation? Not sure which
